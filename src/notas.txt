React App Exits Immediately with Docker Run Command
3-22-2020

Due to a recent update in the Create React App library, we will need to change how we start our containers.

In the upcoming lecture, you'll need to add the -it flag to run the container in interactive mode:

docker run -it -p 3000:3000 IMAGE_ID

Attaching to Web container
In the upcoming lecture, Stephen will accidentally attach to the Web container instead of the Tests container. 
Since the contents of the containers are the same, this will yield the exact same results and the explanation 
remains valid.


Named Builders and AWS
updated 10-1-2020

In the next lecture, we will be creating a multi-step build in our production Dockerfile. When we deploy to AWS in section 7, this currently will fail if you attempt to use a named builder as shown.

To remedy this, we should create an unnamed builder like so:

Instead of this:

FROM node:alpine as builder
WORKDIR '/app'
COPY package.json .
RUN npm install
COPY . .
RUN npm run build
 
FROM nginx
COPY --from=builder /app/build /usr/share/nginx/html

Do this:

FROM node:alpine
WORKDIR '/app'
COPY package.json .
RUN npm install
COPY . .
RUN npm run build
 
FROM nginx
COPY --from=0 /app/build /usr/share/nginx/html
