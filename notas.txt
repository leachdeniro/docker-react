permission denied, mkdir '/app/node_modules.cache' - Linux and WSL2 hosts
-------------------------------------------------------------------------


There is an issue with permissions in regards to Linux hosts (which includes Windows WSL2) and volumes. It can be solved by doing the following:


FROM node:alpine
 
USER node
 
RUN mkdir -p /home/node/app
WORKDIR /home/node/app
 
COPY --chown=node:node ./package.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY --chown=node:node ./ ./
 
CMD ["npm", "start"]


Remember to update the working directory paths in your docker run command to /home/node/app instead of just /app



When we refactor to use Docker Compose, remember to update the working directory paths in your compose file:

volumes:

    volumes:
      - /home/node/app/node_modules
      - .:/home/node/app
Explanation of changes:

We are specifying that the USER which will execute RUN, CMD, or ENTRYPOINT instructions will be the node user, as opposed to root (default).

https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#user

We are then creating a directory of /home/node/app prior to the WORKDIR instruction. This will prevent a permissions issue since WORKDIR by default will create a directory if it does not exist and set ownership to root.

The inline chown commands will set ownership of the files you are copying from your local environment to the node user in the container.

The end result will be that all files and directories in the project will no longer be owned by root and will instead be owned by the node user.




React App Exited With Code 0
4-1-2020

Recently, a bug was introduced with the latest Create React App version that is causing the React app to exit when starting with Docker Compose.

To Resolve this:

Add stdin_open property to your docker-compose.yml file

  web:
    stdin_open: true
Make sure you rebuild your containers after making this change with  docker-compose down && docker-compose up --build

Required Travis Script Updates
In the upcoming lecture, we will be adding a script to our .travis.yml file. Due to a change in how the Jest library works with Create React App, we need to make a small modification:

script:
  - docker run USERNAME/docker-react npm run test -- --coverage
 
instead should be:

script:
  - docker run -e CI=true USERNAME/docker-react npm run test
Additionally, you may want to set the following property to the top of your .travis.yml file:

language: generic 
You can read up on the CI=true variable here:

and environment variables in Docker here:
